# Welcome, explorer!

It's been a month since you entered the jungle. You've braved mosquitos, malaria, jaguars that scream at you from trees, mysterious rustles from the dark corners of the tangled underbrush, spiders, snakes, and drenching downpours. All because of vague rumors of a mysterious ancient site as yet unnamed. Finding it would make your career as an archaeologist.

Finally, your search has proven fruitful: you are standing outside a large pyramid. Consulting your map, you notice that it is not indicated as a known monument. Where are you?

You take your trusty camera out of your backpack and look around.
