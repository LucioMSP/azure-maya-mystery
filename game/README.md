# Welcome, explorer!

It's been a month since you entered the jungle with your guide. You have braved mosquitos, malaria, jaguars that scream at you from trees, mysterious rustles from the dark corners of the tangled underbrush, spiders, snakes, and drenching downpours.

Finally, you have reached the destination you have sought for so many days: you are standing outside a large pyramid.

Your guide looks at the pyramid with apprehension. "You are on your own...this is as far as I can take you. Kak-Tiliw will punish me if I help you more."
