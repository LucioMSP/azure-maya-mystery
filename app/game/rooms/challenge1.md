# A mysterious text

As you put your guidebook back in your backpack, your cellphone starts to buzz. This is strange, as you're far away from any signal. You open your phone, but your texting app crashes.

To read your texts, you'll need to view them on the web.

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/jlooper/azure-maya-mystery-challenge-1) and follow the instructions on the README to launch the site on Azure Static Apps.
