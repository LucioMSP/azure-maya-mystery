# Challenge

"You already know the name of this temple; you simply need to determine the order of the glyphs. I will tell you a clue in the old language: 'yax-muyal-na'. Use your fancy 'machine learning' technology to determine the glyphs."

Clone [this GitHub repo of a machine learning model analysis tool](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Azure-Maya-Mystery-Challenge-3) and follow the instructions on the README to use machine learning to determine the meanings of the glyphs to the best of your ability.
